## üìå Introduction
FlashChat is a group chatting application made using flutter UI software development kit. I've used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. This app allows users to communicate free of cost without any limitations. User can chat with the registered users at real time, User can see the sender‚Äôs mail in the chat.
